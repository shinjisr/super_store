# A test homework

This is a test homework that I practice with model association and how to prevent "n + 1 query".

- This project has 3 models: **Store, Author and Book**.
  - Every store and author has many books, each book has it's author and belongs to store(for sale).

- Each index has been beautified by Bootstrap
